# Coffeeorders-go

is an API for [Front-End Web Development: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/front-end-web-development-the-big-nerd-ranch-guide/)
The book is missing an endpoint, and this GoLang Project recreates those endpoints and is compiled for windows, mac, and linux.

Check Releases Tab to Download and run the binary.

If there is something wrong with the API, please feel free to contibute code or open an issue.

The Current builds are for amd64 processors, and also windows x86.  If you need a different archetecture, let me know. I can add to a future release.
